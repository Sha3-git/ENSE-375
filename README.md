### Features
#### Reflection Calculation (Snell's Law)
* Calculate reflection angles and refractive indices using Snell's Law.
* Understand light behavior when it passes from one medium to another.
#### Albedo Calculation
* Calculate the albedo, the ratio of reflected solar energy to incident solar energy.
* Study the Earth's climate system and the effects of surface changes on climate.
#### Intensity Calculation
* Calculate light intensity based on power and area, or energy, time, and area.
* Optimize lighting solutions for energy conservation and efficiency.
#### User-Friendly Interface
* Simple menu options for selecting different calculations.
* Clear and intuitive prompts for user inputs and result interpretations.
#### Result Interpretation
* Provides meaningful interpretations of calculated values.
* Helps users understand the significance of the results in real-world contexts.
### Installation
#### Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a simple text editor and command line
