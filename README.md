# ENSE-375 Reflection and Refraction Simulator
Shema Dabiri, Conner Williams, Kevin Chi Huang

## Introduction
The Reflection/Refraction simulator will provide the user with an accurate way to simulate how light, and various materials interact with each other in an urban environment. In order to implement the project, we need to identify the different materials used in urban development as well as the different light sources that will be interacting with these materials.

## Problem Definition
Design a light reflection and refraction simulator that approximately reproduces light behaviour on urban planning materials as a plausible means of mitigating issues such as light pollution and damage within communities
