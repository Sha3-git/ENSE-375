# ENSE-375 Reflection and Refraction Simulator
Shema Dabiri, Conner Williams, Kevin Chi Huang

## Introduction
The Reflection/Refraction simulator will provide the user with an accurate way to simulate how light, and various materials interact with each other in an urban environment. In order to implement the project, we need to identify the different materials used in urban development as well as the different light sources that will be interacting with these materials.

## 2.1 Problem Definition
Design a light reflection and refraction simulator that approximately reproduces light behaviour on urban planning materials as a plausible means of mitigating issues such as light pollution and damage within communities

## 2.2 Design Requirements
 ### 2.2.1 Functions
 The refraction and reflection simulator aims to replicate the behaviour of common sources of light--both natural and artificial when interacting with common urban construction materials. It will show the light travel paths based on the angle of incidence of the ray--whether it will be reflected or refracted, and the reflective properties of the incident material. Our simulator will manufacture these interactions in an experimentally constant environment similar to that of urban communities in the summer. Light sources that will be considered will be lasers, sunlight and incandescent bulbs which are often seen in this setting. Materials considered are water, glass, and steel, which are the major reflective materials utilized in urban infrastructure.

 ### 2.2.3 Constraints
 Economic Factors 
 Cost-efficiency: The simulation will allow users to determine what materials will be more effective at reducing light pollution. Shielding light will impact the energy and money that can be saved. 
 Maintenance Costs: After the software is delivered there will be costs for technical support and bug fixes.

 Regulatory compliance (Security and Access) 

 Reliability 
 Accuracy: Reflection and refraction physics formulas will also be utilized to ensure calculations will be consistent and accurate.
 Testing:  Various testing techniques will also be utilized to ensure the system is reliable and able to run at a high standard with no performance issues.

 Sustainability and Environmental Factors 
 Energy Efficiency: Building with environmentally friendly materials will save more energy and in turn reduce the overall carbon footprint.
 Resource management: Efficient code will be written to minimize resource use. 

 Ethics
 Compliance:  The software will follow regulatory and industry standards.
 Integrity: The results and data of the simulation will be presented open and honestly. 

 Societal Impacts
 Health: Can enhance living conditions in urban environments by choosing to build with more effective materials.
 Education: Users are able to learn and experiment with how light interacts with different materials.
