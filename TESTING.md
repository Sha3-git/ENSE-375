# Testing implementations

## Boundary value testing
Our Light Simulator is a calculation reliant application which necessitated a particular focus on our implementation of boundary value analysis. Because the user is allowed to input a range of values in our application, we needed to ensure that all possible invalid inputs were considered and dealt with. Hence, we utilized robust boundary value analysis to ensure nominal values would be calculated correctly and invalid values--caught and dealth with appropriately. Ideally, we wuld have implemented the worst case analysis implementation but this was not a feasible method nor necessary, due to the variety of testing methods used to ensure the quality of our applicaion. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d22d011-d8c8-41dc-bb30-2876c36fea5b)
